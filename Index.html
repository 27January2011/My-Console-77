     <h2> What is Visual Studio?</h2>
     <br>
    <h2>The Visual Studio integrated development environment is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build code, and then publish an app. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a feature-rich program that can be used for many aspects of software development. Over and above the standard editor and debugger that most IDEs provide, Visual Studio includes compilers, code completion tools, graphical designers, and many more features to ease the software development process.</h2>

    <h2>Running JavaScript

        The Console is also a REPL. You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting. For example, Figure 2 shows the Console next to the DevTools homepage, and Figure 3 shows that same page after using the Console to change the page's title. </h2>
